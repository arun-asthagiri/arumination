# Implications of internal and external sources of reward
## Bridging Human and AI Learning through Reinforcement

Reinforcement learning generalizes any machine learning model that is trained with an objective function, which includes virtually all recent and past applications. RL specializes in handling a  reward signal that changes as an agent interacts with an environment but this can be trivialized to a constant signal and applied to any prediction problem where the loss is a fixed function of the model's output and the ground truth. 

Viewing all machine learning as RL allows us to draw a parallel with theories of reinforcement learning in the human brain. Reinforcement learning stems from Skinner's theory of operant conditioning and more generally, the branch of cognitive scientists called behavioralists. Behavioralists suggested that virtually any behavior can be learned by providing positive and negative "reinforcements" thereby rewarding behavior that is similar to the desired outcome and discouraging dissimilar behavior. This theory explains a strikingly wide variety of behavior and also finds itself rooted in brain systems dedicated to this type of learning--namely, the dopaminergic reward system. This reward system in the brain is responsible for our strong urge to seek out things that bring us both long and short-term pleasure. This can explain how patterns of addiction form from drug use to how we develop preferences in art and music. 
Neuroscientists were able to identify changes in dopamine levels at the neuronal level that account for a prediction-error, which is the difference between the expected and received reward. This prediction-error that is measured in the human brain is strikingly similar to the prediction-error that is defined in classical RL techniques such as TD learning (Stutton, Barto).
