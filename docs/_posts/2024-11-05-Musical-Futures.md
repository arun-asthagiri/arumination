Live music has the power to reshape our reality. When it is felt at its deepest, music penetrates our minds and bodies, influencing our perceptions and actions. It is a uniquely strange yet meaningful act that brings groups of humans together. This is a reflection on the future of live music, partly inspired by my attendance of NeuroMusic 2024 with the theme of envisioning the future of neuroscience in music. 

Today is Election Day. In the aftermath of Trump and Kamala's relentless rallying, one can hear the faint echoes of American crowds chanting. These chants are eerily musical. They form hypnotic rhythms that catch like wildfire even if they carry the most hysterical content. And so, world leaders capitalize on the power of the live audience to spread their message and rally their supporters. 

Music provides a critical lens to examine these dynamics as they arise in large social human groups. Quickly bypassing our critical lens, music elicits deep emotional responses, pleasure and an urge to move. A shared musical source, just like a persuasive speaker, can unite an audience. But music goes beyond rhetoric. Unlike a persuasive speaker, it is artistic--there is no singular final message, only the subjective experience of an abstract performance. It aims for expressive communication over and above effective communication. A musician "wins" by provoking the audience in any way; a politician "wins" by convincing an audience in *their* way. 

Research into music and neuroscience through a social psychology lens asks the questions: How does music bring us together? Can we unpack the mechanisms by which social interactions unfold in live performances: audience-audience, performer-audience, audience-performer, performer-performer? Does music-driven synchrony transfer to interpersonal cooperation in other areas?  These key questions are fascinating and may make the magic of live performance more tangible for broader populations and solidify its importance for society. And, to investigate them, scientists are using cutting-edge technology and data-mining techniques to extract meaningful information from these complex dynamics and (often noisy) neural responses. 

However, it is important to recenter on the question of why music. Lauren Fink posed a question during this conference: imagine we had all these dynamics of live performance mapped out and explained...what then? 

One answer is utility. We can use the power of live music to drive cooperation, creativity, emotional regulation and more. While this is slightly different than using music for therapy, there are some similarities; we try to impact another aspect of a person's life by using music as a medium. To do this, we leverage the processes that social musicking uniquely engages including predictive processing, pleasure and reward, emotional processing, motor systems and physiological regulation. By coordinating these processes through directed musical experiences, we can alter the way humans interact with each other to achieve productive and healthy results.

Still, it feels disingenuous and unflatteringly capitalistic to use music as a means to a greater end. To really design
