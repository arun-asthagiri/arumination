## Part I: Evaluating Expressions:
> Remember we talked about finding $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}}$ ? 
> Here are some extensions :)
1. Evaluate the following extended fraction:
$$1+\frac{2}{3+\frac{4}{5}}$$
2. Reduce this:
$$
\frac{1\cdot3\cdot5\cdot…\cdot99\cdot101}{2\cdot4\cdot6\cdot…\cdot98\cdot100}\cdot\frac{100\cdot98\cdot96\cdot…\cdot4\cdot2}{101\cdot99\cdot97\cdot…\cdot3\cdot1}
$$
>I know it looks scary. But face it head on… or maybe upside down.

3. *Challenge*: I’m gonna start by telling you the answer to this one. But your goal is to try to figure out how (and why) ;)

This crazy infinite fraction:
$$
1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{…}}}
$$
somehow reduces to that mysterious number that humans call the “golden ratio”:
$$
\frac{1+\sqrt5}{2}
$$
The question is: *how do you even go about reducing that freaking fraction?* 
> we can solve this one together but you can take a stab at it. Here’s a pretty big hint: *Start by calling that infinite fraction $x$. Can you write $x$ in terms of itself?

## Part II: Equations Practice

1. Solve for x:
$$2+3x = \frac{8+16x+4}{4}$$
2. Solve for x:
$$
2y+3x = \frac{8y^2+16xy+4y}{4y}
$$
> Wait a minute!
> What's the y doing there. Can we still solve for $x$ with *another* variable getting in our way?? 
> hint: yes.
> ***but check!*** Does your answer work for any value of $y$?

>[!tip] It may seem obvious but...
> Looking for patterns (or recurring thingies) can make something tricky become a lot simpler!

3. Solve for x and y:

$$(x+2y)^2 = 5x+8y+3$$
$$\sqrt{5x+9y+4 } = x+2y$$
