# NeuroScouting 1/26 class
Wes and Brian
***

**Started with Baseball**
- Pitcher/batter battle
  - pitches increased pitch speed. Speed-accuracy tradeoff for batter
**Physiology**
* DEVICE USES ***==PPG==*** - uses light into layers of tissue
  * Records heart rate, respiration, HRV, SPO2
* users can view the physiological signal on the front-end - **closed loop**
**Physiology + Stress**
* Mind and body are interrelated - big insight
* ANS (Autonomic Nervous System) - a branch of the peripheral nervous system that regulates all the physiological processes of the organs
  * Sympathetic “Gas pedal”, “fight or fight” - mobilizing energy
  * Parasympathetic - resting - “energy conservation + restoration”
  * ^^ we are balanced between these two systems (somewhere on the spectrum)
  * “Arousal” is related to activity of the Sympathetic Nervous system 
* Best performance occurs at an optimal stress level
***
* **Homeostasis**
  > Achieving homeostasis doesn’t explain everything
  * Stability through constancy
* **Allostatic Regulation** —> survival and reproduction
  * Reallocate resources to maintain stability of an organism *dynamically*
  * Stability through change
***The brain’s fundamental role***
* central autonomic network
  * conductor of autonomic regulation
  * *regulates physiology to anticipate goals*
* Monitors body and outside world
* Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is an indication of how well your brain’s feedback is modifying your heart rate —> how your brain exerts parasympathetic control via Vagus Nerve
  * Low HRV is actually not the goal -> linked to cardio disease
**Double-edged sword of CNS-ANS control**
* allostatic load -> allostatic overload
  * brain predicts well  
    * if you live in constant stress, you maintain a constant arousal 
* therapeutic approaches — flexibility of response
**Role of Music**
* Music has the power to activate circuitry between brain and body
> Being in the zone is harmony between mind, body and environment
* Music can induce states
* respiration rate changes which can change HRV
* ==LIVE MUSIC RESEARCH==
  * Bernardi et al -> “Increase in synchronization of autonomic rhythms between individuals when listening to music”
  * Ardizzi et al “audience spontaneous entrainment during the collective enjoyment of live performances”
  * Czepiel et al. “Synchrony in the periphery: inter-subject correlation of physiological responses during live music concerts”

## NeuroScouting’s Next Program, PAAS
1. MBI Production (expert)  -> BioMobile App (user)
2. Physiological Data returns to expert
3. Alter the intervention based on data
